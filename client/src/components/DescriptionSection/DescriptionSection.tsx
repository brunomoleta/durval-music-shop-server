        The B. C. Rich Mockingbird Legacy ST electric guitar blends iconic '70s
        style with powerful modern tone. Featuring a neck-thru nyatoh body,
        quilted maple top and ebony fretboard, the Mockingbird Legacy ST looks
        as sinister as it sounds. Powered by DiMarzio D Activator humbucker
        pickups, the Mockingbird Legacy ST produces tight, high-gain tone
        perfect for hard rock and metal. The Floyd Rose 1000 Series
        double-locking tremolo system allows radical dive bombs and squeals
        without tuning issues. With premium components like Grover tuners and a
        shred-ready neck profile, the Mockingbird Legacy ST plays fast and stays
        in tune. Paying homage to B. C. Rich's storied history while pushing the
        boundaries of modern rock guitar. The Mockingbird Legacy ST pairs
        DiMarzio D Activator humbucking pickups with an ebony fretboard and
        quilted maple top for a fusion of warm, articulate tone and premium
        esthetics. The D Activator bridge pickup produces tight bass, glassy
        highs and rich midrange perfect for high-gain styles. Grover Imperial
        tuners keep the Mockingbird Legacy ST in tune through radical whammy bar
        dives and squeals courtesy of the Floyd Rose 1000 Series double-locking
        tremolo system. The Mockingbird Legacy ST features a neck-thru nyatoh
        body with wenge stringers for enhanced sustain and resonance. Its
        Shredzilla Ultra Slim Contour neck profile has a satin finish and 24
        jumbo frets for fast, unencumbered playing. A 12" fretboard radius and
        24 5/8" scale length balance comfort and precision. Introduced in 1976,
        the Mockingbird's distinctive reverse offset body style has become a
        hard rock and metal icon. The Mockingbird Legacy ST's quilted maple top
        and Trans Red finish give this classic shape a modern twist.
        Right-handed with a gloss ebony headstock face, the Mockingbird Legacy
        ST makes a bold visual statement on stage.
